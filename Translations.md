# Introduction #

Starcraft 2 is a game that is played all over the world, by people who speak many different languages.  We welcome the help of anyone who would like to translate Evolution Chamber into a new language!

# How can I contribute? #

The process is pretty straight forward:

1. Choose an existing message file that is in a language you are most comfortable translating from.  These files contain all of the text that is used in Evolution Chamber.  They are located at the following URL and are named "messages\_XX.properties", where "XX" is the two-letter abbreviation for the language.

http://code.google.com/p/evolutionchamber/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FEvolutionChamber%2Fsrc%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Ffray%2Fevo%2Fui%2Fswingx

2. Next, do the translating!  Only translate the text to the _right_ of the equals sign.  For example:

`history.delete=Delete`

changes to

`history.delete=*translation*`

3. When you are finished, create a [new issue](http://code.google.com/p/evolutionchamber/issues/entry) or email mike.angstadt@gmail.com.  Include your translated message file.  We ask that only those who are **very fluent** in the language they are translating to submit a translation.

If we accept your translation, you will be listed as a contributor in the credits on the opening screen.
